We can treat this as (batched) gather ops.\r\n  Reshape input tensor so that ij-th gather operation op will apply to ij-th elements in each tile.\r\n\r\nPrototype: \r\nLayout info: https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/main/csrc/kernels.cu#L2130-L2136\r\n\r\n",

(e.g. one hour)\r\n- [x] updated every spot where update_ is called manually\r\n- [x] modified get_sequence to check that the thread is alive, warn if not\r\n- [x] removed max_retries, switched rpc_info to exponential backoff\r\n- [x] fixed a bg that causes RemoteSeq* to lose user-defined hyperparameters (e.g. timeout) upon subsequencing (sequential[3:5])\r\n- [x] moved client-side points strategy to client.routing or consciously decided not to\r\n- [x] ensured that RemoteSequenceManager thread created in get_remote_module properly shuts down when the module is destroyed\r\n- [x] resolved minor affected todos (sanity check: diff should NOT contain todos diff)\r\n- [x] modified tests to no longer use PYTHONPATH\r\n- [x] worked around this error:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n

Moved `src` => `src/petals`\r\n    - Replaced `from src.smth import smth` with `from petals.smth import smth`\r\n3. Moved `cli` => `src/petals/cli`\r\n    - Replaced `python -m cli.run_smth` with `python -m petals.cli.run_smth` (all utilities are now available right after pip installation)\r\n4. Moved the `requirements*.txt` contents to `setup.cfg` (`requirements.txt` for packages is not supported well by modern packaging utils)\r\n5. Increased the package version from `0.2` to `1.0alpha1`",

This way:\r\n    - Users don't need to make changes in the code launching `RemoteSequential` to make it run on a different device.\r\n    - `model.generate()` also starts to support both CPU and GPU.\r\n    - See the draft of the GPU-based [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hhgSYqfN8a5xOCTPDtwNEdecon5t5pUX?usp=sharing) for running inference/generate/forward/backward through the public swarm with BLOOM-176B.\r\n\r\n2. Sets default `low_cpu_mem_usage=True`, client's request timeout to 20 sec.\r\n\r\n3. Removes excess casts to float32 left in Dmitry's code.\r\n\r\n4. (minor) Improves error messages.",

This PR fixes it, so `ServerState.JOINING` is announced periodically in a thread until blocks are loaded.\r\n\r\n- This PR also makes the `Server` class a non-thread, so it runs in the main thread and can catch `KeyboardInterrupt`. This is important, since if we are downloading blocks right now, we need to stop it and send the `ServerState.OFFLINE` message. Note that `ModuleContainer` is still a thread.\r\n\r\n- (minor) For the sake of readability, I moved the `ModuleContainer.create()` definition, so it is now defined before `Server.__init__()` (this is because `.create()` is invoked first).",

        "body": "In this PR:\r\n\r\n1. **The inference session is made fully fault-tolerant.** If a server fails (or doesn't respond within timeout), it will be replaced by one (or more) servers, and the lost attention caches will be regenerated. See the screenshot of how it works below.\r\n\r\n    Here, the 24-layer model is spread across 3 servers, then the intermediate one (holding blocks 8-14) leaves, then a new large server joins and decides to host layers 6-24 (thus closing the gap). The inference session is able to recover the span 8-14 through the new server and successfully continues inference. The results are identical to the ones without failures:\r\n\r\n    <img width=\"1432\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-11-26 at 08 10 49\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8748943/204073193-3b27fb4f-a53b-458d-9e42-44e178455468.png\">\r\n\r\n2. **Forward and backward are made \"gap-tolerant\".** If some servers leave and a gap arises in the swarm (i.e., some blocks are not handled by anyone), the forward and backward pass will not fail anymore. Instead, they will keep retrying until a new path through the model is available. I have checked that the activations/gradients calculated after failure recovery are equal to the ones calculated without failures.\r\n\r\n3. **Fixed an important bug in forward/backward.** Sometimes, `make_sequence()` returns a sequence that is longer than requested (since the last server hosts blocks further than `end_index`). Before this PR, the code actually run the inputs through these extra blocks leading to incorrect results. This affected partial forward passes and partial/full backward passes (since they re-run partial forward passes in case of failures).\r\n\r\n4. minor: **Renamed classes:**\r\n\r\n    - `RemoteTransformerBlockInferenceSession ` -> `_ServerInferenceSession` (since **(a)** it actually handles the whole span instead of a single block and **(b)** it is not designed to be used outside Petals internals)\r\n    - `RemoteSequentialInferenceSession` -> `InferenceSession` (since the previous name is too long and hardly readable)\r\n\r\n5. While working on this PR, I have also discovered a bug in hivemind that leads to an error in Petals. As soon as it is fixed, we should update `requirements.txt` to point to a new hivemind version.
